## React Chatbot

I created my first ever demo Chatbot that recommends courses to you, based on from Udemy.
When the Chatbot asks for personal training, and the user clicks yes,
the Chatbot will ask for their: name, email, phone, and address.
Once, the user has given the Chatbot their info, the users info will be posted to the database

## Technology Used: (PERN Stack)

-Postgres => Database

-Express => Server-Side

-React => Frontend

-Node => Server-Side

## Other Technology Used:
-DialogFlow for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
